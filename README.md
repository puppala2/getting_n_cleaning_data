Introduction

This is the programming assignment for the third course in Data Science Coursera course. The assignment requires to download the data collected using Samsung smart phones by using 30 volunteers. The smart phones are equipped with the accelerometers and gyroscopes, which will generate the data when the 30 subjects are in 6 different activities. The task includes downloading the data, understand the requirements, understand the data structure, read the data into R data sets, clean the data, merge the data, generate tidy data, and finally generate the summary data.

Raw Data: 
For each record it is provided:
======================================

- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

The dataset includes the following files:
=========================================

- 'README.txt'

- 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.

- 'features.txt': List of all features.

- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.

- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.

- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.

- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.

- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.
